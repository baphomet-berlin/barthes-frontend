# Text area layout

## Rationale

### Typical text

TODO: get stats from examples of fragments that would be written from our interface.

Review space, line length, font size afterwards.

### User stories

As an author:

I want the text to be the focus.
I don't want any extratextual information to be in my field of vision.
I want to be able to easily navigate away and back to a fragment, finding the point where I was.
I want to see a portion of the text big enough to contain the point I'm making.

# Space

## Writing area dimensions

1. Dependant on the line length;
2. Expressed in em so that I will find the same formatting on different screens.


# Typography

## Text alignment

Left-aligned, not justified. 

1. It is the standard on the internet;
2. It allows me to easily track the line I was at after leaving and coming back;
3. I don't want to see my cursor move;
4. Justification has awful ripple effects when editing in the middle of a paragraph.

*Examples*: Ommwrite, ZenPen, Focused, Calmly

## Line length

For now, let's keep the standard 55 to 75 charachters.

## Font size

For now, let's keep the often suggested 16px.

## Font face

### Readability

Serifs seem to be ubiquitous in writing applications (excluding the more technical, monospace-based ones).

Serifs also help line recognisability.

The commonly mentioned disadvantages do not apply, considering we have opted for a large font size.

### Identity

I want to get a familiar feeling when I read and write text.

I also want the font to be aspirational: I want to feel a connection with books that inspired me to try the app.

Routlege Classics: Joanna
Penguin Modern Classics: Joanna
Yale: Electra
Gallimard Folio: Baskerville Old Face

### Verdict

Merryweather, Vollkorn and Libre Baskerville seem to be the best candidates.
