The TextBox component returns an editable area which can be either filled with a placeholder or with text.

The initial state of the TextBox is always the last saved state. Saving is an automatic action that happens at a certain time interval or an action triggered by the user.

When not filled with a placeholder, the Textbox contains one Fragment and it cannot contain more than one.
