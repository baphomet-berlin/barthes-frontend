      The subject who is under the ascendancy of the Imagerepertoire
      "offers" nothing in the play of the signifier: he
      dreams little, never pens. If he writes, his writing is
      smooth as an Image, always seeking to reinstate a legible
      surface of the words: anachronistic, in short, with regard
      to the modern text-which, a contrario, is defined by the
      abolition of the Image-repertoire: nothing "novelistic," no
      simulated Image: for Imitation, Representation, and
      Analogy are forms of coalescence: outmoded.
